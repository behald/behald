### 🧠 About Me
I’m passionate about building **data-driven systems** that bridge the gap between raw information and real business value.  
My work lies at the intersection of **Data Engineering, Machine Learning, and Cloud Infrastructure**, where I design **end-to-end solutions** — from pipeline automation to analytics dashboards and model deployment.

💬 I enjoy solving problems around:
- Real-time streaming & pipeline orchestration  
- Cloud-native architecture and cost optimization  
- Predictive & prescriptive analytics for decision-making  
- Generative AI and NLP for education and customer insights
