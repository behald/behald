## 🧠 About Me

I’m passionate about building data-driven systems that bridge the gap between raw information 
and real business value. My work lies at the intersection of Data Engineering, 
Machine Learning, and Cloud Infrastructure — where I design end-to-end solutions 
from pipeline automation to analytics dashboards and model deployment.
